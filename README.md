### Agenda
1. [Basic Git](BasicGit.md)
- Go through the essentials of Git, like setting up a repository, making changes, creating branches, and working with remotes (e.g., GitHub). 
2. [Advanced Git](AdvancedGit.md)
- Advanced Git helps us manage history, resolve conflicts, and keep our project organized when things get complicated.
